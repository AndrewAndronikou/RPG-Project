# RPG-Project

This was originally an assignment for University in my final year, the module it was part of was "Games & AI".

The assignment required me to create any game of my choosing with gameplay mechanics and two AI techniques. I decided to create an RPG as there are lots of features which can be created in order to make it fun, some features I created were:

* Weapon system
* Leveling system
* Finite state machine for AI behaviour
* Flocking
* Random enemy spawner

The way I designed and created this project allowed for the framework to very extendable and I am also currently in the process of taking this project further and extending it to create a full RPG game with different levels, inventory system and questing.

This will be an ongoing project so keep a look out for more features being added.
